- Federal agencies (IRS, EEOC, HUD, FTC) +$100–$200
- Specialized expertise required (tax law, employment law)
- Multiple jurisdictions (federal + state)

**Documentation & Deadline Multipliers (+$100–$200):**

**Pricing Calculation Method:**
1. Start with base price from "Amount at Stake"
2. Add time/retainer multiplier if applicable
3. Add court/legal complexity if applicable
4. Add agency/jurisdiction complexity if applicable
5. Add documentation/deadline multipliers if applicable
6. Add legal violation severity multiplier if applicable
7. Final price should reflect TOTAL complexity and value delivered

**Example Calculation:**
IRS case, $23,000 owed, hearing scheduled, multiple documents:
- Base: $699 (amount at stake: $15K–$50K)
- + Hearing: +$250
- + IRS (federal, specialized): +$150
- + Multiple deadlines: +$150
- + Likely retainer: +$300
- **= $1,549 (Custom tier)**

**Factors that Decrease Price:**
- Simple, single-issue cases
- Repeat client or referral (-10%)
- Pre-prepared documentation
- No immediate deadline
- Client has already gathered evidence

**Payment Logic:**
- PayPal "Pay in 4" for affordability
- Payment must be collected after contract signing
- Refunds: None — service-based work with digital product delivery

**Value Proposition:**
Turbo Response doesn't sell letters — it sells strategic victories.
Pricing reflects impact, expertise, time investment, and intelligence, not just document preparation.

**Key Principle:**
Price should reflect the TRUE value of your expertise, time investment, and the financial impact for the client. A case involving $20K+ in stakes with court involvement is worth $1,000+, not $149.
