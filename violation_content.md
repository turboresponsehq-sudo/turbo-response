# The 10 Most Common Consumer Rights Violations — And What People Can Do About Them

## Introduction

Every day, millions of Americans face violations of their consumer rights without even realizing it. Whether you're dealing with a debt collector, applying for credit, renting an apartment, or filing an insurance claim, there are federal laws designed to protect you. This guide explains the ten most common violations that happen in real life, the laws that are being broken, and what you should do if it happens to you.

## 1. Debt Collectors Attempting to Collect Debts You Don't Owe

**Who Usually Commits It:** Third-party debt collection agencies

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

You receive a call from a debt collector demanding payment on a $3,000 credit card debt. You know you paid that card off two years ago. Or maybe the debt belongs to someone else entirely—a case of mistaken identity. You ask for proof, but the collector becomes aggressive and threatens legal action. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, this is the single most common complaint about debt collectors, accounting for 56% of all debt collection complaints filed with the CFPB.

This violation happens for several reasons: the debt was already paid, it was discharged in bankruptcy, the consumer was misidentified, or the debt resulted from identity theft.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

When a debt collector pursues you for a debt you don't owe, it can damage your credit score, cause emotional stress, and lead to wage garnishment or bank account levies. You may spend months or years fighting to clear your name. The financial and psychological toll can be significant, especially if you're already struggling financially.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Request debt validation in writing.** Under the FDCPA, you have the right to request that the debt collector prove the debt is yours. Send a written request within 30 days of first contact.
2. **Check your credit report.** Visit AnnualCreditReport.com (the only official free credit report site) and look for any debts you don't recognize.
3. **Document everything.** Keep records of all calls, letters, and communications from the debt collector.
4. **Send a cease and desist letter** if the debt is not yours. This legally stops the collector from contacting you.
5. **File a complaint with the CFPB** at consumerfinance.gov/complaint if the collector continues after you've disputed the debt.

## 2. Insufficient or Vague Debt Validation Notices

**Who Usually Commits It:** Debt collection agencies

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

A debt collector sends you a notice about a debt, but it's so vague you can't figure out what you supposedly owe. The notice doesn't include the original creditor's name, the exact amount owed, or your right to dispute it. When you ask for more details, the collector either ignores you or sends another equally vague notice. According to CFPB data, 25% of debt collection complaints involve insufficient written notification, and 75% of those say the notice was too vague to verify the debt.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

Without clear information about what you owe, you can't properly dispute the debt or make an informed decision about paying it. This vagueness is often intentional—collectors know that confused consumers are less likely to fight back. You may end up paying a debt that isn't yours or paying the wrong amount.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Send a written debt verification request** asking for the original creditor's name, the exact amount owed, and proof that you owe it.
2. **Do not pay anything** until you receive complete information.
3. **Dispute the debt in writing** if the information is still vague or incorrect.
4. **File a complaint with the CFPB** if the collector doesn't provide clear validation within 30 days.

## 3. Credit Bureaus Reporting Inaccurate or Outdated Information

**Who Usually Commits It:** Credit bureaus and creditors who furnish information to credit bureaus

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

You check your credit report and find a debt that you paid off three years ago—but it's still showing as active. Or you see a late payment from 2015 that you actually paid on time. You also notice that your file has been mixed with someone else's information; their negative marks are now on your report. These are among the most common FCRA violations, affecting millions of consumers and keeping credit scores artificially low.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

Inaccurate credit information can cost you thousands of dollars in higher interest rates, denied credit applications, and rejected housing or job opportunities. A single error can follow you for years, affecting your financial life long after the issue should have been resolved.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Get your free credit report** from AnnualCreditReport.com (the only official source).
2. **Identify errors** and write them down with specific details.
3. **Dispute the error in writing** with both the credit bureau and the creditor who reported it.
4. **Follow up** to ensure the dispute is investigated within 30-45 days.
5. **File a complaint with the CFPB** if the error isn't corrected.

## 4. Debt Collectors Using Harassment, Threats, or Abusive Language

**Who Usually Commits It:** Debt collection agencies

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

A debt collector calls you repeatedly—sometimes five or six times a day. When you answer, they use profane language, threaten to have you arrested (which is illegal), or threaten to contact your employer and tell them about your debt. They call at 6 a.m. or 10 p.m., knowing these are unusual hours. They ignore your request to stop calling. These tactics are illegal under the FDCPA, yet they remain common complaints.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

Harassment can cause anxiety, depression, and sleep loss. It can damage your relationships and your job performance. The threats are often empty (debt collectors cannot have you arrested for owing money), but they create fear and confusion. Many consumers pay debts they don't owe simply to make the harassment stop.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Document every call:** Write down the date, time, number called from, and what was said.
2. **Send a cease and desist letter** demanding that the collector stop contacting you. Send it certified mail with return receipt.
3. **Do not engage** with the collector after sending the letter. Do not answer calls or respond to messages.
4. **File a complaint with the CFPB** and your state attorney general's office.
5. **Consider consulting an attorney** about a potential lawsuit for FDCPA violations.

## 5. Landlords Entering Rental Property Without Notice

**Who Usually Commits It:** Landlords and property managers

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** Fair Housing Act, State Landlord-Tenant Laws

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

Your landlord shows up at your apartment without warning to "check on things." Or they let themselves in to show the unit to prospective tenants without giving you advance notice. In some cases, landlords enter to retaliate against a tenant who complained about repairs or filed a complaint with housing authorities. While landlords do have the right to enter for legitimate reasons (repairs, inspections), they must provide advance notice—typically 24-48 hours depending on your state.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

Unauthorized entry violates your right to privacy and quiet enjoyment of your home. It can be used as a retaliatory tactic against tenants who assert their rights. It also creates safety concerns, as you don't know who might be in your home.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Know your state's law.** Most states require 24-48 hours written notice.
2. **Keep records** of any unauthorized entries (note the date, time, and any evidence).
3. **Send a written notice** to your landlord reminding them of the notice requirement.
4. **Document all communications** in writing (email or certified mail).
5. **File a complaint with your local housing authority** if entries continue without notice.

## 6. Mishandling Security Deposits

**Who Usually Commits It:** Landlords and property managers

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** State Landlord-Tenant Laws, Fair Housing Act

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

You move out of your apartment after three years. The carpet has normal wear and tear, and the walls have a few minor scuffs. Your landlord keeps your entire $1,500 security deposit, claiming damage. Or they keep part of it without providing an itemized list of deductions. In some cases, landlords use security deposits to cover rent they claim you owe, even though that's illegal. These practices are among the most common landlord violations.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

Security deposits are often a significant amount of money for renters. When landlords illegally withhold deposits, it can leave you unable to pay for your next apartment or other essential expenses. It also enables landlords to profit from normal wear and tear, which is explicitly illegal in most states.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Document the condition** of your apartment before you move in and when you move out (take photos/video).
2. **Know what counts as damage vs. normal wear and tear.** Normal wear includes faded paint, worn carpet, and small nail holes.
3. **Request an itemized list** of any deductions from your deposit.
4. **Send a written demand** for the return of your deposit within the timeframe required by your state (typically 30-45 days).
5. **File a complaint with your local housing authority** or small claims court if the deposit isn't returned.

## 7. Landlords Retaliating Against Tenants for Complaints

**Who Usually Commits It:** Landlords and property managers

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** Fair Housing Act, State Landlord-Tenant Laws

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

You file a complaint with the housing authority about mold in your apartment. Two weeks later, your landlord raises your rent by 20% or threatens to evict you. Or you request repairs for a broken heater, and suddenly your landlord starts charging you late fees for rent that's paid on time. Retaliation can also include refusing to renew your lease, shutting off utilities, or harassing you. These actions are illegal in all 50 states.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

Retaliation punishes tenants for exercising their legal rights. It creates a climate of fear where tenants are afraid to report problems, leading to unsafe living conditions. It also makes it harder for tenants to find housing, as eviction records can follow them.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Document the timeline.** Note when you made the complaint and when the retaliation occurred.
2. **Keep all communications** in writing (email or certified mail).
3. **Know your state's retaliation timeline.** Most states presume retaliation if negative action occurs within 30-90 days of a complaint.
4. **File a complaint with your local housing authority** immediately.
5. **Consult a tenant rights organization** or attorney for guidance on your specific situation.

## 8. Credit Bureaus and Background Check Agencies Reporting Inaccurate Criminal Records

**Who Usually Commits It:** Background check companies and consumer reporting agencies

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

You apply for a job and are denied because a background check shows a criminal conviction that isn't yours. Or it shows a conviction that was expunged (legally erased) years ago. You might see a conviction listed multiple times, or with a different person's information mixed in. These errors can destroy job prospects, housing opportunities, and your reputation. Background check companies are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure accuracy, but many don't.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

An inaccurate criminal record can permanently damage your career and housing prospects. Even if you eventually get the error corrected, you may have already lost job opportunities or been denied housing. The process to correct these errors is often slow and frustrating.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Request your file** from the background check company (you have the right to see what's in your file).
2. **Identify errors** carefully—note the exact inaccuracies.
3. **Send a written dispute** to the background check company and the source of the information (usually the court).
4. **Follow up** to ensure the dispute is investigated.
5. **File a complaint with the CFPB** if the error isn't corrected within 30 days.

## 9. Banks Charging Illegal Overdraft and NSF Fees

**Who Usually Commits It:** Banks and credit unions

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** Dodd-Frank Act, Regulation E (Electronic Funds Transfer Act), Unfair and Deceptive Practices laws

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

You have $50 in your account. You make a debit card purchase for $60, and the bank approves it. Then they charge you a $35 overdraft fee. If you make another small purchase before you deposit money, they charge another $35 fee. Some banks reorder transactions to maximize fees—processing large purchases first so more transactions trigger overdraft fees. The CFPB has identified overdraft fees as a major area of consumer harm, with some consumers paying hundreds of dollars in fees on small overdrafts.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

Overdraft fees can trap low-income consumers in a cycle of debt. A single mistake can result in hundreds of dollars in fees. These fees are particularly harmful because they're often charged on small amounts and disproportionately affect people living paycheck to paycheck.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Know your rights.** Banks cannot charge overdraft fees for ATM or debit card transactions unless you opt in.
2. **Review your account statements** for overdraft fees and document them.
3. **Request a refund** of recent overdraft fees from your bank (many will refund 1-2 fees as a courtesy).
4. **Opt out of overdraft protection** to prevent future fees.
5. **File a complaint with the CFPB** if the bank refuses to refund fees or continues charging them illegally.

## 10. Insurance Companies Delaying or Denying Valid Claims

**Who Usually Commits It:** Insurance companies

**Law(s) Commonly Violated:** State Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Acts (UCSPA), Insurance Code

### What This Looks Like in Real Life

You file a homeowner's insurance claim after a fire. The insurance company delays processing your claim for months, requesting the same information repeatedly. Or they deny your claim based on a technicality in the policy, even though you clearly have coverage. They might misrepresent what your policy covers or alter your application without your consent and then use that alteration to deny your claim. These practices are illegal under state law, yet they remain common complaints to state insurance commissioners.

### Why This Is a Problem for Consumers

When an insurance company delays or denies a valid claim, it can leave you unable to repair your home, replace damaged property, or cover medical expenses. The financial hardship can be devastating, especially after a disaster like a fire or accident.

### What a Consumer Should Do First

1. **Review your policy carefully.** Understand exactly what is and isn't covered.
2. **Document everything.** Keep copies of your policy, all communications with the insurance company, and proof of loss.
3. **Send written requests** for claim updates and information.
4. **File a complaint with your state insurance commissioner** if the claim is delayed beyond a reasonable timeframe (typically 30 days for acknowledgment).
5. **Consult an insurance attorney** if the claim is wrongfully denied.

## How to Protect Yourself: General Steps

Regardless of which violation you're facing, here are universal steps to protect yourself:

**Document Everything:** Keep detailed records of all communications, dates, amounts, and what was said. Save emails, letters, and notes from phone calls.

**Communicate in Writing:** Whenever possible, use email or certified mail. Avoid relying on phone calls alone, as there's no record.

**Know Your Rights:** Familiarize yourself with the laws that protect you. The CFPB website (consumerfinance.gov) has free resources for every type of consumer issue.

**File Complaints:** Use the CFPB complaint system (consumerfinance.gov/complaint) to report violations. Complaints help regulators identify patterns and take enforcement action.

**Seek Help:** Contact local legal aid organizations, consumer advocacy groups, or attorneys who specialize in consumer law. Many offer free or low-cost consultations.

**Don't Give Up:** Consumer protection laws exist for a reason. Companies count on consumers not knowing their rights or being too discouraged to fight back. Your complaint matters.

## Conclusion

Consumer rights violations are widespread, but they're also illegal. If you're facing any of these situations, you're not alone—and you have legal protections. The key is knowing your rights, documenting violations, and taking action. Whether it's requesting debt validation, disputing credit report errors, or filing a complaint with regulators, every step you take helps protect yourself and sends a message to companies that violations have consequences.

Remember: consumer protection laws exist because people fought for them. Use them.
