## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Current Deployment
Your platform is currently running at:
**https://5000-ikmcjxglj62fda1zzn3kq-d6ec9c78.manusvm.computer**

This is a temporary development URL. For production, you'll need to:

### Option 1: Deploy to Production Server
1. Choose a hosting provider (DigitalOcean, AWS, Heroku, etc.)
2. Set up a domain name (e.g., turboresponse.com)
3. Configure SSL certificate for HTTPS
4. Deploy the Flask application
5. Set up a production WSGI server (Gunicorn or uWSGI)
6. Configure environment variables for secrets

### Option 2: Keep Using Manus Deployment
The current Manus deployment URL will work, but:
- URL will change if the sandbox restarts
- Not recommended for production traffic
- Good for testing and demonstration
