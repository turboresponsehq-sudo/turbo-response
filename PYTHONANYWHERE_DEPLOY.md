   - Wait for upload to complete

4. **Extract the Zip File**
   - In the file browser, you'll see `turbo-response-pythonanywhere.zip`
   - Open a Bash console (click "Consoles" â†’ "Bash")
   - Type this command:
     ```bash
     unzip turbo-response-pythonanywhere.zip
     cd turbo-response-backend
     ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (3 minutes)

In the same Bash console, type:

   - Choose "Python 3.10" (or latest available)
   - Click "Next"

3. **Set Up WSGI File**
   - Scroll down to "Code" section
   - Click on the WSGI configuration file link (it will be something like `/var/www/yourusername_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py`)
   - **Delete everything** in that file
   - **Copy and paste this** (I've prepared it for you):

```python
import sys
import os

# Add your project directory to the sys.path
project_home = '/home/yourusername/turbo-response-backend'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path

# Set environment variables
os.environ['FLASK_ENV'] = 'production'
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'change-this-to-random-string-later'
os.environ['DEBUG'] = 'False'

# Import Flask app
from src.main import app as application
```

   - **IMPORTANT:** Replace `yourusername` with your actual PythonAnywhere username
   - Click "Save"

4. **Set Working Directory**
   - Scroll up to "Code" section
   - Find "Working directory"
   - Enter: `/home/yourusername/turbo-response-backend`
   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual username

5. **Reload Web App**
   - Scroll to the top
   - Click the big green "Reload" button

### Step 5: Visit Your Live Site! ðŸŽ‰

Your site is now live at:
**https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com**

Replace `yourusername` with your actual PythonAnywhere username.

**Admin page:**
**https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com/admin_ai.html**

**Admin login:**
- Username: `demarcus`
- Password: `crr2025admin`

## Upgrading to Paid Plan ($5/month)

The free tier is great for testing, but has limitations:
- Your app sleeps after inactivity
- Limited to one web app
- No custom domain

**To upgrade:**
1. Click "Account" in top menu
2. Click "Upgrade to paid account"
3. Choose "Hacker plan" ($5/month)
4. Benefits:
   - Always-on (no sleeping)
   - Custom domain support
   - More CPU time
   - Better support

---

## Adding a Custom Domain (After Upgrading)

1. **In PythonAnywhere:**
   - Go to "Web" tab
   - Scroll to "Setup a new domain"
   - Enter your domain: `turboresponse.com`
   - Click "Add"

2. **In Your Domain Registrar** (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.):
   - Add a CNAME record:
     - **Name:** `www`
     - **Value:** `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`
   - Add an A record:
     - **Name:** `@`
     - **Value:** (PythonAnywhere will show you the IP address)

3. **Wait for DNS** (can take up to 48 hours, usually 1-2 hours)

4. **Enable HTTPS:**
   - In PythonAnywhere Web tab
   - Click "Force HTTPS" toggle
   - Your site will be secure with SSL

---

## Troubleshooting

### Site shows "Something went wrong"
1. Go to "Web" tab
2. Click "Error log" link
3. Check what the error says
4. Common fix: Make sure you replaced `yourusername` in the WSGI file

### Files not uploading
- Free accounts have 512MB storage limit
- Your app is only 57KB, so this shouldn't be an issue
- Try uploading again or use smaller chunks

### Can't find the WSGI file
- Go to "Web" tab
- Look for "Code" section
- Click the blue link that says "WSGI configuration file"

### Dependencies won't install
- Make sure you're in the right directory: `cd turbo-response-backend`
- Try: `pip3 install --user Flask flask-cors Flask-SQLAlchemy`
