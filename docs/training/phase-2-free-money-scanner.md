# Phase 2: Free Money Scanner - Training Document

**Purpose:** Train AI agents on how to identify, score, and present grant/benefit/funding opportunities that increase Zakhy's capital.

---

## Core Concept

The Free Money Scanner is NOT a generic grant finder. It's a **capital optimization engine** that identifies opportunities aligned with Zakhy's life, business, and financial goals.

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Separate FREE MONEY vs LEVERAGE

**FREE MONEY (No Repayment Required):**
- Grants
- Benefits (SNAP, housing assistance, utilities)
- Tax credits
- Rebates
- Certifications that lead to contracts

**LEVERAGE (Must Repay):**
- Loans (SBA, microloans, business loans)
- Lines of credit
- Credit cards
- Financing

**DO NOT label loans as "free money." They are leverage tools.**

### 2. Every Opportunity Must Include

**Required Fields:**
- Title
- Source (organization)
- Type (grant/benefit/loan/certification)
- Eligibility (who qualifies)
- Deadline (urgency)
- Estimated payout ($)
- Time/effort required (hours)
- ROI score (0-100)
- Required documents (checklist)
- Recommended action (priority-based)

**Founder Lens (Required):**
- Why this matters to Zakhy
- Earn / Save / Grow impact
- Best time to execute (evenings/weekends)
- Next action: 1-3 concrete steps

### 3. Verification Labels

**If opportunity is uncertain or generic:**
- Label: **"Needs Verification"**
- Include source link
- Note what needs to be confirmed

**Example:**
```
⚠️ Needs Verification
Georgia Small Business Relief Fund
Source: https://www.georgia.org/small-business-relief
Note: Confirm current availability and eligibility requirements
```

## ROI Scoring System

### Formula
```
ROI Score = Payout Score + Effort Score + Urgency Score

- Payout Score (0-50): $1k = 1 point, max 50 at $50k+
- Effort Score (0-30): 30 points for <1 hour, -2 points per hour
- Urgency Score (0-20): 20 for 30+ days, 10 for 7-30 days, 5 for <7 days
```

### Priority Levels
- **🚨 CRITICAL (70-100):** Apply immediately - highest ROI
- **⚠️ HIGH (50-69):** Apply this week - good ROI
- **👀 MONITOR (<50):** Consider when time permits - lower ROI
