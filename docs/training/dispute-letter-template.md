## Dispute Strategy Guide

### When to Dispute

**High-Priority Targets:**
1. Charge-offs and collections
2. Late payments (30, 60, 90, 120+ days)
3. Accounts with inconsistent information
4. Accounts past statute of limitations (typically 7 years)
5. Duplicate accounts
6. Accounts with missing required data

**Dispute Angles:**
- **Verification Burden:** Bureau must verify with creditor
- **Accuracy Standard:** Information must be "maximum possible accuracy"
- **Incomplete Information:** Missing dates, amounts, or account details
- **Inconsistencies:** Conflicting data within the report
- **Unrecognized Accounts:** Consumer doesn't recognize the account

### Legal Framework (FCRA)

**Consumer Rights:**
- Right to dispute inaccurate information (Section 611)
- Right to have unverifiable items deleted
- Right to receive investigation results in writing
- Right to add consumer statement if dispute denied

**Bureau Obligations:**
- Must investigate within 30 days
- Must contact creditor to verify information
- Must delete unverifiable items
- Must provide written results

**Creditor Obligations:**
- Must investigate when contacted by bureau
- Must provide documentation of debt
- Must correct or delete unverifiable information
- Must cease reporting if cannot verify

### Tone and Language

**Professional but Assertive:**
- Use formal business letter format
- State facts clearly without emotion
- Reference legal rights without threats
- Demand action with specific requests

**Avoid:**
- Angry or emotional language
- Threats of lawsuits (unless you intend to follow through)
- Admitting the debt is valid
- Providing unnecessary personal information

### Follow-Up Strategy

**Timeline:**

   - For questionable information: request verification
   - For incomplete information: request completion or deletion

4. **Include Required Elements:**
   - Consumer identification (name, address, DOB, last 4 SSN)
   - Date and certified mail notation
   - Clear subject line
   - Specific disputed accounts
   - Request for written confirmation
   - Enclosures list
